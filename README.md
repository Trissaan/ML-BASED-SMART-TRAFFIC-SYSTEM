# ML-BASED-SMART-TRAFFIC-SYSTEM

At present, traffic congestion has become a major problem in large number of cities in India due to urbanization. This is caused by various factors. Even though the purpose of traffic signal system is to regulate traffic efficiently, the current systems have proven to be inefficient. Two ML models are required to assist the proposed solution in order to reduce congestion. One is used to generate bounding plot of crowded vehicles. The other one is used to predict the duration of green signal based on the number of vehicles gathered. Out of these, the second model has been developed and tested. A sample dataset has been created with limited features, limited data and assumed values. The developed model has shown approximately 58.4% of accuracy. Hence, we can infer that if this model is trained with an accurate large dataset, a better accuracy could be achieved.
